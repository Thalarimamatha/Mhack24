# Next.js Fullstack Boilerplate

## Introduction

Welcome to the Next.js Auth Boilerplate project, a foundational setup aimed at accelerating your web development process. This boilerplate integrates a range of technologies, providing a streamlined start to building modern web applications.

Live demo: [https://next-boilerplate-umber.vercel.app/](https://next-boilerplate-umber.vercel.app/)

This app features a full Auth system and a dashboard.

For more detailed information, including authentication flows, email system configuration, and more, refer to the [full post on dev.to](LINK_TO_DEVTO_POST)

## Technology Overview

Here's a brief look at some key technologies used in this project:

- 🌐 **Next.js:** The foundational framework for building the React application.
- 💅 **Emotion and Material-UI:** These libraries are used to style the components, ensuring responsive and aesthetically pleasing design.
- 🔐 **Passport:** Manages user authentication with various strategies, including local.
- 📝 **Formik & Zod:** Handle and validate forms, making sure the data is correct.
- 📊 **SWR & Axios:** Deal with data fetching and state management.
- 🔒 **bcryptjs:** Secures user passwords by hashing them.
- 📧 **nodemailer:** Sends emails for things like verification and password resets.
- ⚙️ **next-connect:** A small Express/Connect-style middleware framework for Next.js, facilitating efficient handling of server-side routes and middleware.
- 🗄️ **MongoDB:** The chosen database for this project, utilized for storing user information and managing sessions.
- 📚 **TypeScript:** Adds static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code quality.
- 🧪 **Cypress:** Provides end-to-end testing capabilities, ensuring that the application works as intended.
- 🚀 **Vercel:** The platform for hosting the application, providing a seamless deployment process.

## Architecture and Code Structure

The architecture of the Next.js Auth Boilerplate project is designed to be modular and scalable, following industry best practices. Here's an overview:

- **Frontend (Client-side):** Built with Next.js, the frontend uses React components for UI, styled with Emotion and Material-UI, and handles forms via Formik and Zod.
- **Backend (Server-side):** Utilizes a combination of Next.js API routes, Passport for authentication, and MongoDB for data storage. Axios and SWR assist in data fetching and state management.
- **Testing:** Cypress is integrated into the workflow to facilitate end-to-end testing.
- **Deployment:** Vercel is the preferred choice for hosting, providing a smooth deployment process.
